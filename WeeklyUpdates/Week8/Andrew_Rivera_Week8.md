4. ***What did you accomplish this week?*** _(Be specific)_
  - Finalzed design document, provided feedback and reflected on given feedback from peers.

  - I wrote and completed the test cases that I plan to demo.

4. ***How do you feel about your progress?*** _(brief, free-form reflection)_
  - I feel that good progress was made towards preparation of the end-to-end communication demo, and happy that the design document draft was mostly completed in time for the submission.

  - Our group needs refer to the milestone, and finish given tasks. For myself it is to be able to send the encoded video feed from pi1 to pi2.
  - After the demo, the design document needs to be updated to reflect the given feedback from peers.
    
6. ***Is anything blocking you that you need from others?*** _(What do you need from whom)_
  - No, there is nothing blocking me that is needed from others at this moment.
