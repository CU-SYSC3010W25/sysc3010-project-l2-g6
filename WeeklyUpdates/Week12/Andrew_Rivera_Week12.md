4. ***How do you feel about your progress?*** _(brief, free-form reflection)_
  - I feel good about the progress, I am excited to present the project to our TA. Although, I am a little bummed out that the AI model is not as refined and has a hard time recognizing gestures from me.
    Regardless, it is able to correctly recognize the gestures using photos. I think my hand gestures are just bad and the model thinks they are different letters.
