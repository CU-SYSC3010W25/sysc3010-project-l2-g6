4. ***What did you accomplish this week?*** _(Be specific)_
  - Vaanu and I made final edits to the GUI
  - Our team met up a couple times to complete the full projet and prepare for the final demo, and record our video.
  - Video was completed and submitted

4. ***How do you feel about your progress?*** _(brief, free-form reflection)
  - Our system is largely complete and runs well, with features performing just as intended. The gesture recognition occasionally slips up, but that’s more of a growing pain than a flaw. It comes down to how the model’s been trained, how the hands are positioned, and even the lighting in the room. It’s a great reminder that AI’s accuracy often depends on the little things, and we're already thinking ahead to how we can refine it further.

6. ***Is anything blocking you that you need from others?*** _(What do you need from whom)_
  - No, there is nothing blocking me that is needed from others at this moment.
