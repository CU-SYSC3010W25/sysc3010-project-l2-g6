## Weekly Individual Project Update Report

### Group number: L2-G6

### Student name: Kyle Mathias

### Week: Week 4

1. **How many hours did you spend on the project this week?** 5

2. ***Give rough breakdown of hours spent on 1-3 of the following:* (meetings, information gathering, design, research, brainstorming, evaluating options, prototyping options, writing/documenting, refactoring, testing, software implementation, hardware implementation)***

- Top item: Group Meeting, 3 hours

- 2nd item: Research, 2 hours

3. **What did you accomplish this week? (Be specific)**
- The group held a meeting, where we discussed distribution of tasks, as well as the project design report, and wrote up a list of the milestones and progress for each week.
- Did individual research on specifics of AI interpretation using Tensorflow Lite and opencv, and did some research into communication protocols for video broadcasting.
- Group started project proposal and assigned parts of the proposal to members.

4. **How do you feel about your progress? (brief, free-form reflection)**
- Good progress was made this week, group created milestones and divided tasks appropriately, as well as began working on the project proposal and created an outline for what progress will be made each week during the development phase.
- Researching the communication protocols will save us time later by not having to test multiple forms of communication.
- Since we know which AI libraries we'll be using, we can start putting together a code draft and look into how we'll make the AI work in the project.

5. **What are you planning to do next week? (give specific goals)**
- Next week, group will finish the proposal and check it to make sure it is thorough.
- Will also begin to look into optimization to allow the Pi to be as efficient as possible when it comes to processing the video, essentially how to get the Pi to process the most video, extremely quickly.
  
6. **Is anything blocking you that you need from others? (What do you need from whom)**
- At the moment, there is nothing that is blocking me that is needed from others.
