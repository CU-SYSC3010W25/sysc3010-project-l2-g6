4. ***What did you accomplish this week?*** _(Be specific)_
  - Designed and integrated GUI functionality to update the database whenever the microphone or speaker buttons are toggled, modifying the isHearing and isSpeaking settings accordingly.
  - Built GUI features to pull the live MJPEG stream from Andrewâ€™s camera and retrieve the current gesture and stream status from the Firebase database.
  - Collaborated with the team to align on our approach for the unit test demo, and showcased individual progress during our meeting.
  - Created comprehensive unit tests for the GUI, ensuring the live stream is displayed correctly, the HTTP server is accessible, the current gesture appears as expected, and button interactions update Firebase in real time.
