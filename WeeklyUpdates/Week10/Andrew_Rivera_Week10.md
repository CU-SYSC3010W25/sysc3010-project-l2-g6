1. **How many hours did you spend on the project this week? (0-10)** 
   -  10 hours

2. **Give rough breakdown of hours spent on 1-3 of the following:***
   (meetings, information gathering, design, research, brainstorming, evaluating options, prototyping options, writing/documenting, refactoring, testing, software implementation, hardware implementation)
  - Hardware implementation: 4 hours
  - Meeting: 2 hours
  - Unit Testing: 3 hours
  - Documentation: 1 hour
   
4. ***What did you accomplish this week?*** _(Be specific)_
  - Refactored and modified the servo implementation for the camera mount.
  - Met with the group to discuss plans for the unit test demo, and demonstrated our progress to each other.
  - Developed unit tests for the servo and camera components for the demo.
  - Prepared an updated unit test document to present to the TA for the demo. 

4. ***How do you feel about your progress?*** _(brief, free-form reflection)_
  - I feel that good progress has been made towards the project. Despite setbacks, good compromises were made and I still have confidence in our project. After seeing the progress made towards the GUI and the Ai Recognition, I feel that we are getting close to finishing the project.
    
5. ***What are you planning to do next week***? _(give specific goals)_
  - I plan on creating a sketch to 3D print a case for our final design. and creating the mount for camera and servo. And to combine our individual Pis to better represent the system we want to build. Also to get started on writing the final report.
    
6. ***Is anything blocking you that you need from others?*** _(What do you need from whom)_
  - No, there is nothing blocking me that is needed from others at this moment. Although I would like to consult my team for their opinions on the overall look of the final design.
