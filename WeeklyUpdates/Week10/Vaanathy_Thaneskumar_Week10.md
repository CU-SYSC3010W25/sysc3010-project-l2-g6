4. ***What did you accomplish this week?*** _(Be specific)_
  - Worked on GUI to update database when microphone/speaker buttons are clicked (Updating settings isHearing and isSpeaking in database)
  - Implemented GUI fetching stream and current gesture from firebase DB and mjpeg stream from Andrew's camera.
  - Met with the group to discuss plans for the unit test demo, and demonstrated our progress to each other.
  - Developed unit tests for the GUI to test stream is displaying, http server is able to be accessed, currentGesture is being outputted on GUI, and buttons are updating firebase DB in real time. 
  - Prepared an updated unit test document to present to the TA for the demo. 

4. ***How do you feel about your progress?*** _(brief, free-form reflection)_
  - I am feeling excited about the project. We are able to see everything come together, especially with the gesture recognition that Kyle was able to get done. It feels like majority of the project is complete and now we are working on some fine tuning and extra details. I was definitely a little worried for a second about the progress we made on our project as a team however, after the unit test demo I am a lot more confident.
    
5. ***What are you planning to do next week***? _(give specific goals)_
  - Divya and I plan on implementing some changes that Andrew gave us about our GUI (Adding an up and down arrow to be able to update the servo angle and direction from a signing user's input). This doesn't seem to be a very difficult change to implement as the approach would be similar to the microphone and speaker buttons we've already implemented.
  - I also plan on getting some work done on our final project document, and thinking about our final poster and video demo.
    
6. ***Is anything blocking you that you need from others?*** _(What do you need from whom)_
  - No, there is nothing blocking me that is needed from others at this moment.
