## Weekly Individual Project Update Report

### Group number: L2-G6

### Student name: Kyle Mathias

### Week: Week 7

1. **How many hours did you spend on the project this week?** 5

2. ***Give rough breakdown of hours spent on 1-3 of the following:* (meetings, information gathering, design, research, brainstorming, evaluating options, prototyping options, writing/documenting, refactoring, testing, software implementation, hardware implementation)***

- Top item: Group Meeting, 1 hours

- 2nd item: Implementation, 4 hours

3. **What did you accomplish this week? (Be specific)**
- The group held a meeting, where we discussed what needed to be completed for the first week of the project, we
brought our individual research together and also worked on the design report.
- Began implementation of system, including physically connecting Pis 1 and 2 together through ethernet, and
ensuring that they recognized each other and were able to communicate. Then established video stream connection
from Pi 1 to Pi 2.

4. **How do you feel about your progress? (brief, free-form reflection)**
- Very good progress was made this week, the hardware part of Pi 2 is complete, as it now receives the video stream
from Pi 1 using RTSP.

5. **What are you planning to do next week? (give specific goals)**
- Next week the group will finish establishing connections between Pis for the end to end demo and ensure that all
Pis are capable of communicating.
- Next week I will be setting up the Pis processing to ensure that the OpenCV library on Pi 2 is able to receive the
video stream, and process each one of its frames to detect a gesture.
- Next week I will also be going to the SCE department to learn how to use the 3D printer to print a case for the
system.
  
6. **Is anything blocking you that you need from others? (What do you need from whom)**
- At the moment, there is nothing that is blocking me that is needed from others.
