## Weekly Individual Project Update Report

### Group number: L2-G6

### Student name: Kyle Mathias

### Week: Week 6

1. **How many hours did you spend on the project this week?** 2

2. ***Give rough breakdown of hours spent on 1-3 of the following:* (meetings, information gathering, design, research, brainstorming, evaluating options, prototyping options, writing/documenting, refactoring, testing, software implementation, hardware implementation)***

- Top item: Group Meeting, 1 hours

- 2nd item: Research, 1 hours

3. **What did you accomplish this week? (Be specific)**
- The group held a meeting, where we finalized the project breakdown including group member tasks.
- Did research on how to optimize Raspberry Pi for AI processing, found that the best way to handle temperatures was to
remove casing and sense HAT for maximum air flow, and fans connected to GPIO to cool.

4. **How do you feel about your progress? (brief, free-form reflection)**
- Good progress was made this week, slightly less than usual due to exams.
- One of the biggest challenges was how to optimize the processing Pi to deal with temperatures and we found a solution.

5. **What are you planning to do next week? (give specific goals)**
- Next week the group will begin the process of putting the system together. This includes connecting the hardware and creating
the foundation for the software, as well as establishing connections between the Pi nodes.
  
6. **Is anything blocking you that you need from others? (What do you need from whom)**
- At the moment, there is nothing that is blocking me that is needed from others.
