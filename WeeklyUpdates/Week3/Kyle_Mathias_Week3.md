Weekly Individual Project Update Report

Group number: L2-G6

Student name: Kyle Mathias

Week: Week 3

How many hours did you spend on the project this week? 3

Give rough breakdown of hours spent on 1-3 of the following:* (meetings, information gathering, design, research, brainstorming, evaluating options, prototyping options, writing/documenting, refactoring, testing, software implementation, hardware implementation)

Top item: Group Meeting, 2 hours

2nd item: Research, 1 hour

What did you accomplish this week? (Be specific)
- The group held a meeting, where we discussed the feasibility of the project, as well as a breakdown of tasks, and shared research that group members had done individually. Group decided how to fulfull certain requirements, such as deciding on pi camera and microphone as sensors, and a camera adjusting motor for the actuator requirement. Group also decided on functionality of certain elements, such as the GUI to display output and alternate input between users.
- Did individual research on AI libraries and database storage on raspberry pi, finding that images and other media can be stored within databases, and narrowing down the AI libraries needed for the project to openCV and PyTorch.
- Group settled on project being sign language interpreter using RPi.
- Group decided on roles/tasks for each individual RPi: image capture and filtering, image processing, output through speaker and LED array, GUI control.
- Group came up with solution to important issue, where the RPi may not be able to handle searching for each letter in every frame of live video feed. Solution: first have processor check that a hand is being raised in frame, only then begin searching for each letter.

How do you feel about your progress? (brief, free-form reflection)
- Good progress was made this week, group not only settled on project idea, but also narrowed down some of the specifics, as well as solved some important issues that wouldve caused problems during the development phase of project.
- Having the specifics narrowed down this much allows us to focus less on trying to test multiple ideas that may not work, and focus more on how to integrate the ideas that we're more confident will work.

What are you planning to do next week? (give specific goals)
- Next week, group will being draft of project proposal, and bring more ideas on how to simplify the project.
- I'll be researching ways that will allow an RPi to efficiently transfer media to another RPi, as well as how to process the transferred media quickly in real time, and will bring my research to the next meeting. 
  
Is anything blocking you that you need from others? (What do you need from whom)
- At the moment, there is nothing that is blocking me that is needed from others.
