## Weekly Individual Project Update Report
### Group number: L2-G6
### Student name: Andrew Rivera
### Week: Week 3
1. **How many hours did you spend on the project this week? (0-10)** 
   - 3 hours

2. **Give rough breakdown of hours spent on 1-3 of the following:***
   (meetings, information gathering, design, research, brainstorming, evaluating options, prototyping options, writing/documenting, refactoring, testing, software implementation, hardware implementation)
   1. Top item: Group meeting, 2 hours
   2. 2nd item: Individual research, 1 hour
   
3. ***What did you accomplish this week?*** _(Be specific)_
  - Discussed and brainstormed the feasability of our project idea, we managed to decide and commit to the project idea because of the motivation behind it after thorough discussion.
   - Our group was able to decide and lay out a rough plan on how we want to use our RPIs, python libraries, and databases we want to use to implement the sign language interpreter.
   - We also briefly discussed how we can meet the most of the project checklists, and draw diagrams of how we want it to work and look.
   - Furthermore, we were able to decide on the roles for the specific RPis we are going to use and come up with solutions to possible difficulties we may encounter.
   - I spent an hour researching about sign language interpreters using Python on YouTube to see how others have designed it, to draw some ideas on how we want to execute ours in a different way. Within that hour, I also prepared a pre project proposal document to prepare for our weekly Friday meetings. And practiced using the camera on the RPi.

4. ***How do you feel about your progress?*** _(brief, free-form reflection)_
  - I feel that good progress was made. We were able to decide on the project idea, outlined the hardware we needed and the specific roles for our RPis, and brainstorm the types of software we plan to use to implement the project.
    
5. ***What are you planning to do next week***? _(give specific goals)_
  - Work on project proposal. Ideally have a completed rough version.
  - Research and learn more about what the RPi can do for the project. Such as practicing with the camera.
    
6. ***Is anything blocking you that you need from others?*** _(What do you need from whom)_
  - No, there is nothing blocking me that is needed from others.
